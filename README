RCNN - GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a graphical interface to be used with /RichardKelley/rcnn. It
will eventually have some sort of graphic representation of the network
as well as an interface for working with a running network. This is a 
client for RCNN which runs as a server.

TODO:
  -Work on the OpenGl section and learn about JOGL
  -Once netcode for RCNN is done, test the node manipulation features
  -Finish integrating the UI with the simulation
  -Build the networking panel

Most GUI work needs to be done on my home machine since the linux machine
struggles trying to interpret the source code. Don't know why.
