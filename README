RCNN - GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-TODO:

	-- Latest of the latest:
		-It works. Bring me your nodes and your values. I will use 
		all of them. Please tell me if you need anything else or if
		you get some wonky results.

	-- Even more latest:
		-Made a single proof of concept oscilloscope using junk data.
		Once I sort out my problem with play framework I'll get some
		real data in there. Then I'll make ALL of the oscilloscopes.

	-- Latest:
		-Added a persistent data structure for nodes. They (should) now
		keep track of their latest 500 values. This will be required to 
		build the oscilloscope. Could not test because play-rcnn gave me 
		errors on compilation. 
		
	-- IMMEDIATE TODOS:
		-start handling some of the todos.
		-actually delete some of the data i created

	-- Networking Loop
		-formalize network infrastructure (did a good bit of that already)
	
	-- Simulation Loop
		-Build backbone for simulation
	
	-- Render Loop
		-Interconnect simulation and render loop
	
	-- GUI work
  		-fix the damn dialog boxes
  		-on select of node list, display relevant edges
  		-update edge list regularly
