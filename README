RCNN - GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-TODO:

	- Extract more interfaces. This half-commitment to interface use is terrible.
	
	- Work on the force graph
	
	- Formalize the subview interface. Enforce consistency.
	
	- Remove the activation level from the edge list in guiView.
	
	- Load and Save functionality. This is going to be the big one.
