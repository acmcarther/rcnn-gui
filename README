RCNN - GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-TODO:

	- Extract more interfaces. This half-commitment to interface use is terrible.
	
	- Formalize the subview interface. Enforce consistency.
	
	- Remove the activation level from the edge list in guiView.
	
	- Load and Save functionality. This is going to be the big one.
	
	- Handle all of the todos
	
	- Try not to use the GFX classes in a static way. Not good practice. 
	
	- Make nodes 3d, edges 3d & Indicate direction
